      <h1>What is this all about?</h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently working on this simple and static website, which will always be updated with extremely reliable
        information. I'll try to provide references whenever possible, but there will definitely be additions based on
        my previous background in these subjects. I've always been fascinated by analytical activities, and now that I'm
        older, I understand the crucial <span>need for having holistic knowledge</span> to succeed in both personal and
        career life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal isn't just to write, but to provide the clarity I didn't have when learning all the content documented
        here. Our privacy is decreasing because we're becoming a product of something way bigger than we think; It's
        crucial that we <span>understand the attacks</span> and how they work so that we can <span><b>protect
            ourselves</b></span> from them. I had to search for information in various places, which was spread out and
        separated, making learning tedious and <span>NOT INTUITIVE</span>; here, all you need to do is navigate through
        the pages in the sidebar.
        The design is meant to be as simple and minimalist as possible to direct all your attention and focus on what
        really matters: <span><b>the knowledge</b></span>. So, don't be surprised by the wide range of topics and texts
        I'll add here; they all have a sub-purpose, and if you make an effort to understand, I guarantee it will make
        sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span><b>Please, if you have enough curiosity and determination to make a better world, feel free to reach out
            to me through the links in the footer.</b></span><br>Thank you.
      </p>
