        my main priority with that experiment is to verbalize my thoughts and experiences. i want to express all of this in a generic and practical way - using science-based knowledge, for example, to help you understand the principles we all need in order to build our own independent highway - i'll repeat: you can emulate every step from the writings here (even if it doesn't make sense), and you must. because if you don't, then you'll not be able to recognize the patterns, the only limits are your beliefs + creativity. once you start realizing the beauty of it, no moral qualities will affect your judgment. if you don't resonate with my methodology, i invite you to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        i'll give my best shot to keep it easy for you to dive into this manual:<br><strong>1. be a human</strong>, <strong>2. having internet access</strong>. <br>
        "originality can only arise when you are connected to yourself. it is an act of honesty". that's a must here. my goal isn't recognition, but to spread research, streamline the reality because others already complicate it too much. we need less, not more. life is counterintuitive. question everything - and what they tell you not to question is even more questionable.
