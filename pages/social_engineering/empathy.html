              The basis of social engineering is to make someone give you something that you want without them realizing the
              manipulation required for it to occur. Individuals typically don't want to know the truth or face the reality of
              things. They often prioritize security, personal affirmation, comfort, and whatever reinforces their current
              beliefs. They agonize when facing the actual state of things - but we will talk about this later on. As long as
              your idea is presented in a way adapted to the person's style, they will accept it, and you will gather the
              benefits
              through it.

              Some brain chemicals, such as neuromodulators and neurotransmitters, are "triggered" in specific social
              situations. As previously discussed, our body is one with our mind, and social engineering is like a domino
              effect; once you achieve satisfactory states, the person simply opens up genuinely and gives you access to all
              kinds of information. It is extremely crucial to say that this is not a constant process; there will be
              failures, and you will need to identify which aspect of the other person you missed. Thus, you can build a more
              solid foundation of empathy.

              Social interactions are so crucial to the point of having a neurological balance circuit – communicating and socializing are literally life necessities. I'm not saying it's impossible to live alone, without talking to anyone, isolated in a mountain. It can be done. However, the consequences that will follow <strong>will</strong> be painful, it's a direction contrary to nature. The body will try to compensate for this absence, for example, with an excess of cortisol and adrenaline – making the individual aggressive/irritated/anxious...not good at all.

            <p>
              The lack of <strong>control over thoughts</strong> is constantly triggering conflicting and unnecessary situations. The ability to <strong>not</strong> react is becoming increasingly difficult to build, given that we are bombarded with stimuli, making us impulsive and non-conscious of our actions.

              One of the biggest psychological (and egoic) needs of humans is to be heard, to be 'seen' or noticed. We can view this characteristic as a gap to be exploited.

            <strong>ps. the subject here isn't about right or wrong, bad or good. i'm talking about goals, not debating moral qualities. your body doesn't get those abstract words, it's a superficial thing.</strong>
