            <h1>facial expressions</h1>

            <p>It's not just about one factor, it never was about that. The human ability to gather massive amounts of
                information is often overlooked – but it makes sense, too, because we're not consciously doing this
                process alone. Most of it is computed by our more primitive mechanisms, by the structures that make our
                heart beat, our kidneys filter liquids, and you automatically read this now, etc...</p>
            <p>
                These things are SO COMMON that we forget about the brain's capacity. They're such natural processes
                that you don't even notice
            </p>

            <p>
                Our emotions arise from external stimuli, which produce thoughts, and consequently, generate feelings;
                we have a response to it, a biological signature. No matter how hard someone tries to manipulate, alter,
                or even conceal certain information – notice that it will be reflected in their behavior (and there are
                various analytical approaches to this, the most subtle changes occur in facial muscles and nerves).

            <h2>universal recognition</h2>
            <p>
                There are, roughly (they mix and get different names), 6 types of generic facial expressions .
            </p>
            <!-- <ul>
      <li>anger</li>
      <li>disgust</li>
      <li>fear</li>
      <li>joy/hapiness</li>
      <li>sadness</li>
      <li>surprise</li>
    </ul> -->
            <p>
                I'll put extreme images so we can understand the fixation patterns. Is necessary to practice in daily
                life, but with caution, don't go staring at others like a crazy maniac person.
