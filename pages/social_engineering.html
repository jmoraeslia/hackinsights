      <h1>
        understanding how people works
      </h1>

      <p>
        To learn how we can 'hack people,' we need to first understand how our body and mind work together. <br>
        This section is a bit complex because we're talking about human beings - which implies that we also need to
        understand that each person has unique and completely different characteristics. <br>
        I'm willing to write about techniques and principles that may not be officially established by contemporary
        science because I strongly believe it's all about what actually gets the job done in real life. If people or
        professionals have tested and are currently reaping the rewards through certain social engineering arts (which I
        firmly think is a science), it's worth sharing them here.
      </p>

      <h2>mind and body are intrinsically connected</h2>

      <p>
        You might hear out there that these two actors are completely separate and disparate things, but rest assured
        that over the years of evolution, we naturally created a two-way relationship between the body and the mind.
        A interesting exercise for you to test this theory (clear your mind, don't expect anything, and don't practice
        this with any pre-established emotion):
      </p>

      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          . clench your fists as if you're about to punch something;
        </li>
        <li>
          . make an angry/hateful facial expression, furrow your eyebrows, and clench your jaw;
        </li>
        <li>
          . take a deep breath, flaring your nostrils.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you did everything correctly, you felt the emotion coming, adrenaline being released, and perhaps your heart
        rate increased a bit - maybe imperceptibly. <br>
        Now, let's reverse engineering it (without pre-expressions):
      </p>
      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>. just think about a situation where you felt deep hatred, relive it with as much detail as possible;</li>
        <li>. try to replicate the inner state from that moment. It's almost impossible to do this exercise while
          laughing;</li>
        <li>. notice how the changes triggered by the pre-computed anger thoughts affect your facial and/or bodily
          expressions (even if they're minimal).
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        you can practice this with any type of emotion; the results may be weaker
        or stronger depending on how dedicated you are or the strength of the emotion you're trying to evoke. <br>
        try it for at least 60 seconds for noticeable results.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this is about figuring out how our body changes show what's going on in our heads - and vice versa. It's
        pretty cool because it can be a handy rule of thumb for all of us. You can dive deep into some pretty specific
        stuff, but there's a catch - those tiny changes don't always apply when you're dealing with every single person.
        So, don't jump to conclusions without gathering as much information as possible; practice consistently, test,
        gain experience, observe changes, and try to understand how they fit into the context of the other person. Learn
        from these fundamental ideas and apply them in any suitable social situation. As a result, you'll start noticing
        patterns in human behavior that are common to all of us - and this becomes a cycle of perpetual learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, it's up to you what you'll do with this knowledge. Try to use it to become a better person (it'll make sense
        further).

      <h1>
        how get everything you want
      </h1>
      
      <h2>empathy</h2>
      <p>
        The basis of social engineering is to make someone give you something that you want without them realizing the
        manipulation required for it to occur. Individuals typically don't want to know the truth or face the reality of
        things. They often prioritize security, personal affirmation, comfort, and whatever reinforces their current
        beliefs. They agonize when facing the actual state of things - but we will talk about this later on. As long as
        your idea is presented in a way adapted to the person's style, they will accept it, and you will gather the
        benefits
        through it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some brain chemicals, such as neuromodulators and neurotransmitters, are "triggered" in specific social
        situations. As previously discussed, our body is one with our mind, and social engineering is like a domino
        effect; once you achieve satisfactory states, the person simply opens up genuinely and gives you access to all
        kinds of information. It is extremely crucial to say that this is not a constant process; there will be
        failures, and you will need to identify which aspect of the other person you missed. Thus, you can build a more
        solid foundation of empathy.
      </p>

      <h3>a process, not an event</h3>

      <p>
        Social interactions are so crucial to the point of having a neurological balance circuit – communicating and socializing are literally life necessities. I'm not saying it's impossible to live alone, without talking to anyone, isolated in a mountain. It can be done. However, the consequences that will follow <strong>will</strong> be painful, it's a direction contrary to nature. The body will try to compensate for this absence, for example, with an excess of cortisol and adrenaline – making the individual aggressive/irritated/anxious...not good at all.

      <h2>intelligence speaks, but wisdom listens</h2>

      <p>
        The lack of <strong>control over thoughts</strong> is constantly triggering conflicting and unnecessary situations. The ability to <strong>not</strong> react is becoming increasingly difficult to build, given that we are bombarded with stimuli, making us impulsive and non-conscious of our actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the biggest psychological (and egoic) needs of humans is to be heard, to be 'seen' or noticed. We can view this characteristic as a gap to be exploited.
      </p>
      <strong>ps. the subject here isn't about right or wrong, bad or good. i'm talking about goals, not debating moral qualities. your body doesn't get those abstract words, it's a superficial thing.</strong>

      <h1>facial expressions</h1>

      <p>It's not just about one factor, it never was about that. The human ability to gather massive amounts of information is often overlooked – but it makes sense, too, because we're not consciously doing this process alone. Most of it is computed by our more primitive mechanisms, by the structures that make our heart beat, our kidneys filter liquids, and you automatically read this now, etc...</p>
      <p>
        These things are SO COMMON that we forget about the brain's capacity. They're such natural processes that you don't even notice
      </p>

      <p>
        Our emotions arise from external stimuli, which produce thoughts, and consequently, generate feelings; we have a response to it, a biological signature. No matter how hard someone tries to manipulate, alter, or even conceal certain information – notice that it will be reflected in their behavior (and there are various analytical approaches to this, the most subtle changes occur in facial muscles and nerves).
      </p>

      <h2>universal recognition</h2>
      <p>
        There are, roughly (they mix and get different names), 6 types of generic facial expressions .
      </p>
      <!-- <ul>
        <li>anger</li>
        <li>disgust</li>
        <li>fear</li>
        <li>joy/hapiness</li>
        <li>sadness</li>
        <li>surprise</li>
      </ul> -->
      <p>
        I'll put extreme images so we can understand the fixation patterns. Is necessary to practice in daily life, but with caution, don't go staring at others like a crazy maniac person.
