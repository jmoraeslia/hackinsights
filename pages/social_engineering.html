        understanding how people works
        <!--Individuals typically don't want to know the truth or face the reality of things. They often prioritize security, personal affirmation, comfort, and whatever reinforces their current beliefs. Actually, they agonize when facing the actual state of things.-->
      </h1>

      <p>
        To learn how we can 'hack people,' we need to first understand how our body and mind work together.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section is a bit complex because we're talking about human beings - which implies that we also need to
        understand that each person has unique and completely different characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm willing to write about techniques and principles that may not be officially established by contemporary science because I strongly believe it's all about what actually gets the job done in real life. If people or professionals have tested and are currently reaping the rewards through certain social engineering arts (which I firmly think is a science), it's worth sharing them here.
      </p>

      <h2>mind and body are intrinsically connected</h2>

      <p>
        You might hear out there that these two actors are completely separate and disparate things, but rest assured
        that over the years of evolution, we naturally created a two-way relationship between the body and the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        A interesting exercise for you to test this theory (clear your mind, don't expect anything, and don't practice
        this with any pre-established emotion):

      <ul>
        <li>
          . clench your fists as if you're about to punch something;
        </li>
        <li>
          . make an angry/hateful facial expression, furrow your eyebrows, and clench your jaw;
        </li>
        <li>
          . take a deep breath, flaring your nostrils.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you did everything correctly, you felt the emotion coming, adrenaline being released, and perhaps your heart
        rate increased a bit - maybe imperceptibly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's reverse engineering it (without pre-expressions):
      <ul>
        <li>. just think about a situation where you felt deep hatred, relive it with as much detail as possible;</li>
        <li>. try to replicate the inner state from that moment. It's almost impossible to do this exercise while
          laughing;</li>
        <li>. notice how the changes triggered by the pre-computed anger thoughts affect your facial and/or bodily
          expressions (even if they're minimal).
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: rgb(43, 189, 58);">ps: you can practice this with any type of emotion; the results may be weaker
        or stronger depending on how dedicated you are or the strength of the emotion you're trying to evoke. <br>
        try it for at least 60 seconds for noticeable results.
      </h3>

      <p>
        All of this is about figuring out how our body changes show what's going on in our heads - and vice versa. It's pretty cool because it can be a handy rule of thumb for all of us. You can dive deep into some pretty specific stuff, but there's a catch - those tiny changes don't always apply when you're dealing with every single person. So, don't jump to conclusions without gathering as much information as possible; practice consistently, test, gain experience, observe changes, and try to understand how they fit into the context of the other person. Learn from these fundamental ideas and apply them in any suitable social situation. As a result, you'll start noticing patterns in human behavior that are common to all of us - and this becomes a cycle of perpetual learning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So, it's up to you what you'll do with this knowledge. Try to use it to become a better person (it'll make sense further).
